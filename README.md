- 👋 Hi, I’m @VelOBor, AKA Oleg. Born in 1981 in a small town in USSR.
- 👀 I’m interested in Arduino, 3D printing, RasPi, open source and general DIY
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, but it's slow going due to being absorbed in an Arduino project, and after it's completed I'm getting back to restoring my 3D printer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of my projects that might spark your fancy
- 📫 How to reach me on discord - just join this server and ping Salty https://discord.gg/evhSn35THX but please don't spam join just for giggles.
